Currently, this repository contains a parser for the popular corpus query language, CQP.

CQP grammar is parsed by the [Lark Python module](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) which parses context-free grammars in [eBNF notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) into its abstract syntax tree.

The details of the implemented CQP dialect can be found in [the corresponding document](./docs/cqp_dialect.md).
